♿ Disability Access Bridge

🚀 Overview
Disability Access Bridge is a web-based platform designed to bridge the accessibility gap for people with disabilities by providing resources, education opportunities, 
and tools to help them navigate both digital and physical environments. The project focuses on inclusivity, regional accessibility (with emphasis on Rajasthan), and innovative features such as voice navigation,
image-to-text conversion, and sign language recognition.

1. Inclusive Navigation: Built for maximum accessibility with features like zoom, screen readers, and voice-over support.
2. Integration of a Computer Vision model to enable navigation through simple Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures via webcam.
3. Community-Verified Resources: Aggregates verified information on disability rights, policies, grants, and support networks.
4. Introduces an Accessibility Score system where users rate real-world locations and services.
5. A Predictive Analytics model processes this crowdsourced data to recommend the most accessible options to users.
6. AI-Driven Career Matching: A dedicated career portal powered by AI-driven personalization to suggest career paths, job opportunities, and skill-building resources tailored to users.
7. Integrated Sign Language Support for an inclusive job search experience.
