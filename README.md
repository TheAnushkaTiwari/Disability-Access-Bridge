♿ Disability Access Bridge

🚀 Overview
Disability Access Bridge is a web-based platform designed to bridge the accessibility gap for people with disabilities by providing resources, education opportunities, 
and tools to help them navigate both digital and physical environments. The project focuses on inclusivity, regional accessibility (with emphasis on Rajasthan), and innovative features such as voice navigation,
image-to-text conversion, and sign language recognition.

Current Features
🔊 Voice Feature: Screen reader integration with text-to-speech.
🔍 Zoom In/Out: Adjustable display settings for visually impaired users.
📝 Feedback System: Collects accessibility feedback from users.
🔐 User Login & Signup: Secure user accounts for personalization.

🔮 Future Roadmap:
The platform is currently a prototype with placeholder resources. In the future, it will expand into three powerful pillars:

1. Inclusive Navigation: Built for maximum accessibility with features like zoom, screen readers, and voice-over support.
2. Integration of a Computer Vision model to enable navigation through simple Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures via webcam.
3. Community-Verified Resources: Aggregates verified information on disability rights, policies, grants, and support networks.
4. Introduces an Accessibility Score system where users rate real-world locations and services.
5. A Predictive Analytics model processes this crowdsourced data to recommend the most accessible options to users.
